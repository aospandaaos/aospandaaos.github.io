### Introduction
[slides](https://2net.co.uk/slides/aosp-aaos-meetup/2025-november-introduction.pdf)

### Talk 1: What is the state of Android on RISC-V?

Yuning Liang joins us to talk about his experience developing RISC-V devices,
which today mostly run Linux distros such as Debian. Looking forward, Yuning
draws on his experiences working at Nokia and Huawei to highlight the roadblocks
that are preventing Android becoming a first class operating system for RISC-V.
Yuning's enthusiasm is apparent, as is his eccentric choice of head gear

A round table discussion about Google's proposed requirement for developer
registration and the implications for "sideloading"

## The September 2025 Meetup

17th September 2025: <https://www.meetup.com/the-aosp-and-aaos-meetup/events/309610342/>

### Talk 1: Mastering SELinux in AOSP: From Frustration to Control

SELinux is often seen as a blocker when working with AOSP — especially when "avc: denied" messages get in the way. But when understood and managed properly, SEPolicy becomes a powerful tool to harden and structure your system. In this talk, you’ll learn:
* Why SELinux is critical to Android security
* How to manage and maintain SEPolicy in real AOSP projects
* Proven techniques to debug and fix policy issues

## The July 2025 Meetup

16th July 2025: <https://www.meetup.com/the-aosp-and-aaos-meetup/events/307910082/>

### Talk 1: Writing Android system apps

Normal apps are limited by the constraints of their sandbox. System apps, on the other hand,
can escape the sandbox to varying extents. In this talk, I explain the various levels of
system app and how to build them in AOSP

## The March 2025 Meetup

19th March 2025: <https://www.meetup.com/the-aosp-and-aaos-meetup/events/305840348/>

### Talk 1: Using Vendor APEX in AOSP

Vendor APEX modules allow developers to package entire feature implementations, such as the WiFi HAL, into a single, self-contained unit. The advantages are faster iteration, simplified testing, easier debugging, and modular updates.

### Talk 2: Feedback from OSS and Linux Plumbers Conference in Vienna
Last week there were two important conferences: the Open Source Summit Europe (OSSE)
and Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC), both taking place in the city of Vienna.

I will give an overview of the topics presented and give you a flavor of some
of the conversations that went on in the hallways in between

### Talk 2: Automotive AOSP Ecosystem: challenges and opportunities for App Developers

In the last few years we've seen an increasing adoption from Automotive OEMs of
Android based In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) platforms. While there are
differences between platforms running with and without Google Automotive
Services (GAS), the majority of apps can actually be built once and run
anywhere, which is a paradigm shift for the industry. We'll discuss the
different categories of automotive apps and what is being done at COVESA to
avoid ecosystem fragmentation.

### Talk 3: You Can't Escape the Past: How early design decisions continue to influence Android today
Chet Haase talks about the team that built the Android operating system and why
they chose to do certain things certain ways: the graphics stack, security
model, the app programming language ... these are things that affect us every
day

### Talk 2: What to expect in Android 15

While the source code for this year's Android 15 'Vanilla Ice Cream' release

changes, and documentation. Here's a summary of what to expect

### Talk 2: Adventures with Systrace - measure and investigate the glass to glass latency in Android
What is the glass to glass latency in Android? This means how much delay is
between the camera, taking a picture, and the screen, to display the picture
again. This presentation is a technical tour through the Android graphics
system and hardware. From the measurement setup, based on cables, LEDs,
photodiodes and an oscilloscope, to camera sensors and the rolling shutter
effect, to displays and refresh rates, to surfaceflinger and vsyncs, and last
but not least to the ultimate tool to debug most of your performance issues, to
Android's systrace
