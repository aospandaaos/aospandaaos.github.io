## The September 2024 Meetup

### Talk 1: The COVESA AOSP SDK

Through the Automotive AOSP App Framework Standardization Expert Group, members
of COVESA are working on an SDK that provides a set of libraries which allow
third-party applications to access some automotive features in a way that is
independent of manufacturer and model

### Talk 2: Feedback from OSS and Linux Plumbers Conference in Vienna
Last week there were two important conferences: the Open Source Summit Europe (OSSE)
and Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC), both taking place in the city of Vienna.
There were a lot of AOSP developers there and many talks on AOSP topics. Here,
I will give an overview of the topics presented and give you a flavor of some
of the conversations that went on in the hallways in between

### Talk 2: Automotive AOSP Ecosystem: challenges and opportunities for App Developers

In the last few years we've seen an increasing adoption from Automotive OEMs of
Android based In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) platforms. While there are
differences between platforms running with and without Google Automotive
Services (GAS), the majority of apps can actually be built once and run
anywhere, which is a paradigm shift for the industry. We'll discuss the
different categories of automotive apps and what is being done at COVESA to
avoid ecosystem fragmentation.

### Talk 3: You Can't Escape the Past: How early design decisions continue to influence Android today
Chet Haase talks about the team that built the Android operating system and why
they chose to do certain things certain ways: the graphics stack, security
model, the app programming language ... these are things that affect us every
day

### Talk 2: What to expect in Android 15

While the source code for this year's Android 15 'Vanilla Ice Cream' release
won't be made public before early September (estimated), there's a lot we can
glean about this release from Google's current developer previews, AOSP code
changes, and documentation. Here's a summary of what to expect

### Talk 2: Adventures with Systrace - measure and investigate the glass to glass latency in Android
What is the glass to glass latency in Android? This means how much delay is
between the camera, taking a picture, and the screen, to display the picture
again. This presentation is a technical tour through the Android graphics
system and hardware. From the measurement setup, based on cables, LEDs,
photodiodes and an oscilloscope, to camera sensors and the rolling shutter
effect, to displays and refresh rates, to surfaceflinger and vsyncs, and last
but not least to the ultimate tool to debug most of your performance issues, to
Android's systrace
