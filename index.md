# Meetups

We have an on-line meeting every two months, starting in March 2022 (so in
2022, that is March, May, July, September, and November). Each meeting is 2
hours, starting with 10 minutes meet and greet, followed by three or four talks
on any topics that we find interesting, followed by time for networking
